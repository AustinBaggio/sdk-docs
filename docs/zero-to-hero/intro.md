# Crossword Puzzle

Throughout this series, we'll build a smart contract that awards users with NEAR for solving a crossword puzzle, along with a React frontend to genereate and solve these puzzles in the browser. The complexity of the project will build over the course of 3 sections:

1. **Basics**: In this section we'll create a proof-of-concept smart contract that lets us set the solution of a single puzzle and solve it, along with a React frontend.
2. **Intermediate**: In this section we...
3. **Advanced**: In this section we...

## What You'll Learn

Once you've completed this tutorial you'll know:

- How to write a smart contract in Rust
- How NEAR's account system works
- What access keys are, the different types, and how to use them
- How to perform multiple operations in a single transaction using NEAR's powerful actions system
- How to use JavaScript to interact with smart contracts

## Prerequisites

Very little is required to get started. We expect you have a grasp of modern web devleopment, but we'll walk you though installing the necessary tooling. Since we're developing a web application that interacts with a blockchain, it's a good idea to understand the concepts behind what we're doing. To that end, here are the questions you should be able to answer, along with resources to find those answers:

- [What is a blockchain?](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/new-to-near#what-is-a-blockchain)
- [What is NEAR Protocol?](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/new-to-near#what-is-near)
- [What are smart contracts?](https://docs.near.org/docs/develop/contracts/overview)
