# Basics overview

This first chapter of the crossword puzzle tutorial will introduce fundamental concepts to smart contract development in a beginner-friendly way. By the end of this chapter you'll have a proof-of-concept contract that can be interacted with via [NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/docs/tools/near-cli) and a simple frontend that uses the [`near-api-js` library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/near-api-js).

Assumptions on what we're building:

- There will be only one crossword puzzle with one solution.
- The user solving the crossword puzzle will not be able to know the solution.
- Only the author of the crossword puzzle smart contract can set the solution.

Let's begin!
